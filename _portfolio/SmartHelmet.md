**Project Overview**
The Smart Helmet project is a research initiative under the University of Utah's Robotic Systems Lab. The goal of the project is to reduce the risk of traumatic brain injury (TBI) by building novel, soft-robotic helmets. By replacing the impact-absorbant foam or plastic in a traditional helmet with compressible, robotic bladders, the impact can be intelligently distributed on the headform in the least damaging way possible. My primary contribution to the project concerns embedding electronics into these bladders that can in real time sense impacts, and trigger solenoid valves to either vent or pressurize the air chamber. It turns out that this system is extremely challenging to design, as the space constraints are quite small, and the environment inside the bladder requires some clever sensing techniques to operate correctly.
